# VIVIXX

These are all of the tasks I finished for the Vivixx Coding Bootcamp Term 1 (5 June 2017 - 7 July 2017), which was an intro to Ruby programming and basic HTML and CSS.


## WEEK 1

The Week 1 folder isn't very organized, but it /is/ very literal.

- array.rb - First day learning about arrays

- day4.rb - Text decorations and ASCII text

- day4challenge.rb - Voting program

- day5.rb - Learning about using def-end for small functions

- day5challenge.rb - Banking/ATM program

- ex8.rb - Exercise 8 from Learn Ruby The Hard Way

- firstday.rb and trial.rb - Literally the first day of class, trial.rb is what I did in the afternoon, just to try out how gets.chomp works

- gbv1.rb and gbv2.rb - Two versions of the Good Burger program, a small cashier-type program

- greenygreen.rb and puts.rb - Two versions of a plant nursery program, unfinished

- hash.rb - The day we learned about hashes

- makibaka.rb - A small typing exercise I did on the first day

- quad.rb - Using the quadratic equation to get the values of x


## WEEK 2

More unorganized and literal folder and file names....

- day8 - I missed the morning session so I was a litle lost, which is why there are so many files in day8 (day82 was supposed to be day8-2). This was when we learned how to do testing. Mine works for Hamilton tracks.

- day9 - This was when we started working with CSVs.


- foodhub - This was the 2-day challenge. Mine is based off the cashier program from the previous week.

- teamprace - Aaaand this is the failed/earlier version of the foodhub program.

- atm-class.rb - I redid the banking/ATM program from the previous week with classes.

- day7challege.rb and car2.rb - This was another class-based program. Mine is about Mario Kart.

- car2.rb is the updated file (I think)

- classmate.rb and day6.rb - The intro to classes or object-oriented programming.

- day7.rb - Learning about attr_accessor

- name_error.rb - Error messages

- newtrial.txt, openthething.txt, and trial.txt - Opening and accessing .txt files

- vote-class.rb - I redid the voting program from the previous week with  classes. I don't think it works properly, hahaha


## WEEK 3

More literal folder and file names...

- compliments - My first gem!

- day11 - A cake customization program, with lots of CSVs

- day13_html - The first day (re)learning HTML and CSS, my "first" website

- day14 - Creating our own CSS for CSS Zen Garden

- day15 - Recreating a website. (I chose Dribbble)

- weather - The sample gem from Jason/CFA

- aren_html.zip - The zipped day13_html files

- day12.rb - attr_reader mapping and sampling


## WEEK 4

- day16 - Trying out more layouts

## NOTES:

Most of these files were done really quickly, which was honestly surprising for me cause I had no coding background prior to this, but I've been doing quite well in the class. I'd like to think that this is indeed the beginning of a beaaautiful relationship with coding.
