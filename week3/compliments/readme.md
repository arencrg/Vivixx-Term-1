GV!

My gem took me like, 30 minutes to make. It's super simple and it simply gives you a nice compliment after you enter your name. It's nothing useful, but it is cute... So at least it has that going for it. =)))

I just looked up a bunch of compliments (cause I was too lazy to type everything myself), put it all in an array, added the #{name} so it feels personalized. It gets a sample and prints it. That's pretty much all it does. =))) The gemtry.rb file is what asks for the name and asks if you want to do it all over again.

1) gem install coms-0.0.1.gem
2) on the irb, require 'coms'
3) You can use it right then and there by itself with Compliments.whatscookin(name) or use it with the attached gemtry.rb so that you can do it over and over (if you really need the reaffirmation, I guess.)

So, uh, yeah. Here's some good vibes.
